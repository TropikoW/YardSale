# YardSale
YardSale is a project where I wanted to build an eCommerce website as a sample for a shop.
The core code is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.The products are stored in a simple array and rendered in the DOM to
create targets with information about each product. For each 'click' on the 'add' button, the information is pushed to another array.
Additionally, for each click on the 'x,' the product that was clicked is removed from the array.
